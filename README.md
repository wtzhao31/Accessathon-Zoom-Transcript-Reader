# Accessathon-Zoom-Transcript-Reader
This program was written for the annual Teach Access Accessathon. An Accessathon is similar to a Hackathon, but teams compete to develop a prototype for a platform or technology that improves an aspect within the field of acessability. My team chose to focus on the issue of note taking services provided for college students with disabilities. Many technologies and platforms such as Sonnocent, Note Taking Express, and peer note taking are currently being used to serve college students with disabilities, but it's hard to predict which note taking services will be most effective, as this specific need varies from disability to disability and from student to student. Our solution was to create a repository or database where students with disabilities could have access a wide variety of notes for a specific session of a specific class. This would then allow them to personalize and customize which types of notes work best for them. Examples of the different kinds of notes include typed-up notes that could be read with a screen reader, notes that were handwritten and then scanned, etc. 

Another idea that was suggested to us was having the user be able to manipulate Zoom audio transcripts in a way that organized the transcript in a organized way. And that's exactly what this program does. Written in JavaFX, this program reads in a Zoom .txt audio transcript file and displays it in a pop up window, along with several parameters the user can maniuplate to organize the transcript into class notes. The program automatically recognizes the different speakers of the Zoom meeting, which allows the user to filter by speaker. Furthermore, specific key words could also be filtered as well. As this was part of an Accessathon, it is important to recognize this program as a prototype, as current features could be even more refined and more features could be added in the future.
